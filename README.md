## Design
Before stepping into any coding and architecture decisions, I first had to come up with a sort of idea of how I wanted the app to look, and the kind of experience I wanted users to have when using the app. This also guided my decisions on what architecture and tools were best suited to bring this user experience to life. In addition to having a search screen and a detail screen, I also added a search history screen where users can revisit any previously searched item without needing to type text into the search bar and wait for results.
As seen in the images of the app above [Design](#Design), the app launches into the recent searches screen where the user can either see their recent searches or a prompt that tells them their recent searches will be displayed there later. If the user has recent searches, there's also a button that allows the user clear them.

Typing text into the search bar transitions the user into a `searching state` which could lead to loaded search results, empty or error state.

One thing to take into account is how much state handling needs to be done in order to deliver a stellar user experience. This is why I chose to use the `Model-View-Intent` architecture for the presentation layer of the app. This will be discussed in-depth in the section below.

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture mainly because of the many benefits it brings to software which includes scalability, maintainability and testability.
It also enforces separation of concerns and dependency inversion where higher and lower level layers all depend on abstractions. In the project, I separate my layers into different gradle modules namely:

- Domain
- Data 
- Remote 
- Cache
These modules/layers are Java/Kotlin modules except cache. The catch here is that we want independence from the Android framework. One of the key points of clean architecture is that your low level layers should be platform agnostic. We can plug our Domain, data and presentation layers into a kotlin multiplatform project and it will run just fine because we don't depend on the android framework. The cache and remote layers are implementation details that can be provided in any form (Firebase, GraphQl server, REST, ROOM, SQLDelight, etc) as long as it conforms to the business rules / contracts defined in the data layer which in turn also conforms to contract defined in domain.
The project also has one feature module `character_search` that holds the UI code and presents data to the users. The main app module does nothing more than just tying all the many layers of our app together. 

#### Presentation
As stated earlier, the presentation layer is implemented with MVI architecture. There is a kotlin module called presentation which defines the contract of what our apps presentation should look like. The layer is also platform agnostic, allowing us to switch implementation details like whether to use ViewModel or not at will.

MVI architecture defines a uni-directional data flow structure for our project.  
#### Domain

#### Data

## Testing

## Tech stack

Libraries used in the whole application are:
- [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way 
  and act as a channel between use cases and ui
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides abstraction layer over SQLite
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - type safe http client and supports coroutines out of the box.  
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - JSON Parser,used to parse requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable and default parameters
- [okhttp-logging-interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - logs HTTP request and response data.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines,provides `runBlocking` coroutine builder used in tests
- [Truth](https://truth.dev/) - Assertions Library,provides readability as far as assertions are concerned
- [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) - web server for testing HTTP clients ,verify requests and responses on the star wars api with the retrofit client.
- [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) - Unit test on android framework.
- [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) - Test framework to write UI Tests
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt)
- [Kotlin Gradle DSL](https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-build-logic-from-groovy-to-kotlin)
